3 What is the IP address assigned to each interface?

4 Identify your current IPv4 address.

5 Demonstrate how to enable and disable a network interface.

6 How many packets were received (RX) and transmitted (TX) by your interface?

7 Are there any packet errors or drops recorded?

8 Open and view the contents of the /etc/hosts file.

9 How can you edit the hosts file using a text editor?

10 What entries are listed by default in the /etc/hosts file?

11 What is the IP address assigned to localhost?

12 Open and view the /etc/shadow file (requires root privileges).

13 Explain the colon-separated fields in the /etc/shadow file.

14 View the /etc/passwd file and describe what information it contains.

15 Capture DNS queries and responses.

16 Capture ARP packets

17 Filter packets from a specific IP address.

18 Display packets sent to a specific destination port (e.g., 80).

19 Identify an HTTP GET request.

20 View the payload data of a TCP packet.

21 Export packet capture to text or CSV format.

22 Count the total number of packets captured

23 How does Wireshark color-code packets

24 Explain how Wireshark measures round-trip time (RTT).

25 Capture only ICMP traffic (ping).

26 Use traceroute (or tracert on Windows) to show the route packets take to reach google.com.

27 Run traceroute or tracert to different websites and compare the results.

28 Identify local, regional, and international hops in the traceroute output.

29 Note where latency increases significantly and discuss possible causes.

30 How do you find the IP address of a website using nslookup?

31 How do you find mail servers (MX records) for a domain using nslookup?

32 How can nslookup be used for DNS troubleshooting?

33 What is a verbose scan, and how is it performed using nmap?

34 Run an nmap scan on Google’s IP to check open ports and services.

35 Perform an nmap scan on scanme.nmap.org and identify open services.

36 Run a verbose scan on google.com and interpret the output.

37 Perform a verbose scan on your local IP (e.g., 192.168.56.1) to identify open ports.

38 Use ping to send ICMP echo requests to google.com. What does the output show?

39 Ping the local IP 192.168.56.1 and compare the response time.

40 How can ping results help assess network connectivity and latency?

41 Apply a filter to show only TCP packets.

42 Apply a filter to show only HTTP traffic.

43 Capture DNS queries and responses.

44 Capture ARP packets.

45 Filter packets from a specific IP address.

46 Display packets sent to a specific destination port (e.g., 80).

47 Identify an HTTP GET request.

48 View the payload data of a TCP packet.

49 Export the captured packets to a text or CSV file.

50 Count the total number of packets captured.

51 Write a SQL injection command that shows a Reflected XSS example where user input is displayed back on the page without sanitization, demonstrating a potential XSS vulnerability.

52 Retrieves the database at security level low

53 Extracts all the usernames and passwords from the database.
